## State Management with Pinia

[Pinia](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia) is the _intuitive, type safe and flexible Store for Vue_. Our leaderboard app will use a Pinia store to manage the application state, handling data fetching, caching, and real-time updates

1. Real-time Updates: Pinia allows for seamless integration of WebSocket data, enabling instant leaderboard updates without page refreshes, enhancing the real-time feel of the application.

2. Caching and Performance: Pinia can cache leaderboard data locally, reducing unnecessary API calls and improving load times, especially beneficial for frequently accessed leaderboard information.

3. Consistent State Across Components: Ensures that all components (e.g., main leaderboard, player profiles, mini-leaderboards) display consistent data, preventing discrepancies in displayed scores or rankings.

4. Complex Filtering and Sorting: Facilitates efficient client-side filtering and sorting of leaderboard data, allowing for quick toggles between different views (e.g., daily, weekly, all-time) without server requests.

5. Optimistic UI Updates: Enables immediate UI updates for user actions (like submitting a new score) before server confirmation, providing a responsive feel while handling asynchronous operations in the background.

6. These benefits are crucial for the user experience as they contribute to a smooth, responsive, and interactive leaderboard that feels dynamic and engaging, essential for maintaining user interest in a competitive gaming context.

### Pinia Colada Integration :tropical_drink:

By leveraging [Pinia Colada](https://github.com/posva/pinia-colada), we can get a powerful data fetching layer that integrates well with Pinia and Vue 3, providing a smooth and reactive experience for your leaderboard SPA. Bonus :trophy:


1. Automatic Caching: Pinia Colada offers smart client-side caching with request deduplication. This is particularly useful for a leaderboard where you might need to frequently fetch updated scores without overwhelming your API.

2. Async State Management: It handles async state seamlessly, which is crucial for real-time leaderboard updates. This can help in managing loading states and error handling more efficiently.

3. TypeScript Support: With full TypeScript support, you can ensure type safety across your leaderboard components, reducing potential bugs and improving developer experience.

4. SSR Support: If at some point we decide to implement server-side rendering for improved initial load times, Pinia Colada's SSR support will be beneficial.

5. Query Invalidation: The ability to invalidate queries easily (as shown in the example with caches.invalidateQueries) is perfect for updating the leaderboard when new scores are submitted.

### Pinia Colada Example
Here's a quick example of how we can leverage Pinia Colada in the leaderboard component:


```typescript
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryCache } from '@pinia/colada'
import { getLeaderboard, submitScore } from '~/api/leaderboard'

const { data: leaderboard, isLoading } = useQuery({
  key: ['leaderboard'],
  query: () => getLeaderboard(),
})

const caches = useQueryCache()

const { mutate: updateScore } = useMutation({
  mutation: submitScore,
  onSettled() {
    // Invalidate and refetch leaderboard after score update
    caches.invalidateQueries({ key: ['leaderboard'], exact: true })
  },
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <LeaderboardDisplay :data="leaderboard" :is-loading="isLoading" />
    <ScoreSubmissionForm @submit="updateScore" />
  </div>
</template>
```

This setup allows for efficient data fetching, automatic updates after score submissions, and clean separation of concerns in our leaderboard component.
