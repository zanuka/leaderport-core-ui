## Alien Signals Overview

I plan to experiment with and possibly utilize the cutting-edge [alien-signals](https://github.com/stackblitz/alien-signals) project, since it can provide significant performance benefits for Valkran's real-time leaderboard system due to its high performance and lightweight nature. Key benefits include:
- ~400% faster than Vue 3.4's reactivity system
- Minimal memory overhead through strict constraints:
  - No dynamic objects
  - No use of Array/Set/Map
  - No recursion calls
  - Limited class properties (<10)

### Goal
The stated goal of alien-signals is to create a Signal library with the lowest overhead.

### Implementation Examples

#### 1. Real-time Score Updates
```typescript
import { signal, computed } from 'alien-signals';

// Player score tracking
const playerScore = signal(0);
const playerRank = computed(() => calculateRank(playerScore.get()));

// Update score with minimal overhead
playerScore.set(newScore); // This will automatically trigger rank recalculation
```

#### 2. Leaderboard State Management
```typescript
import { signal, computed, effect } from 'alien-signals';

// Leaderboard state
const leaderboardData = signal([]);
const topPlayers = computed(() => 
  leaderboardData.get().slice(0, 10)
);

// Automatically update UI when data changes
effect(() => {
  updateLeaderboardUI(topPlayers.get());
});
```

#### 3. Batch Updates for Performance
```typescript
import { startBatch, endBatch, signal } from 'alien-signals';

// Batch multiple score updates
startBatch();
playerScores.forEach(score => {
  const playerSignal = signal(score);
  playerSignal.set(calculateNewScore(score));
});
endBatch(); // Single update trigger
```

### Implementation Considerations

Since alien-signals is currently in **Preview** status, consider:
1. Running thorough performance tests with Valkran-specific use cases
2. Having a fallback plan in case a switch to a more mature solution is needed
3. Monitoring the project's development and upcoming features
