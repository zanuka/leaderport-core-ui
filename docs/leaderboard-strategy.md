### 7. Developer Experience

Adding a leaderboard to your project should be an enjoyable experience, not something you dread. LeaderPort aims to make the process a breeze with its simple installation and configuration process.

#### Quick Start Integration

_Note: This is currently in brainstorm draft-mode, all subject to change as project matures :-)_

Initialize in your project:

    import { LeaderPort } from '@leaderport/core';
    import { SuiProvider } from '@leaderport/sui';

    const leaderboard = new LeaderPort({
      provider: new SuiProvider(),
      projectId: 'your-project-id'
    });

#### Core Features
Submit scores with a single line:

    await leaderboard.submitScore({
      playerId: '0x123...',
      score: 1000,
      category: 'weekly-challenge'
    });

Configure your leaderboard:

    const config = {
      updateFrequency: '1m',          // Real-time, 1m, 5m, etc.
      resetSchedule: '0 0 * * MON',   // CRON expression
      scoreStrategy: 'highest',       // highest, lowest, latest, cumulative
      tiebreaker: 'timestamp',        // timestamp, secondary_score
      archiveEnabled: true,           // Store historical data
      maxEntries: 100000,            // Maximum entries per leaderboard
    };

#### Ready-Made Components
Drop-in React components:

    import { LeaderboardView, PlayerCard } from '@leaderport/react';

    <LeaderboardView 
      category="weekly-challenge"
      layout="vertical"
      showRank
      showScore
      showTimestamp
    />

#### Advanced Integration Examples
Real-time updates:

    leaderboard.subscribe('weekly-challenge', {
      onUpdate: (scores) => {
        console.log('New scores:', scores);
      },
      onReset: () => {
        console.log('Leaderboard reset');
      }
    });

Custom scoring formulas:

    leaderboard.setScoreStrategy('pvp-ranking', {
      calculate: (stats) => {
        return (stats.wins * 100) + (stats.kills * 10) - (stats.deaths * 5);
      }
    });

#### Developer Tools
Command-line interface:

    leaderport init        # Project setup
