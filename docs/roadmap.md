## LeaderPort Development Phases

### 1. Project Setup 
- [x] Initialize GitHub repository with MIT license
- [x] Create Roadmap outlining key deliverables
- [x] Create initial README with project description and setup
- [x] Create supporting markdown files
- [x] Set up basic project structure

### 2. Research & Development
- [ ] Evaluate and prototype alien-signals:
  - [ ] Set up test implementation
  - [ ] Benchmark performance characteristics
  - [ ] Test integration with Bun/Hono
  - [ ] Document findings and recommendations
- [ ] Assess alternative WebSocket solutions
- [ ] Evaluate different state management approaches
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept for critical features

### 3. Back-end Development 
- [ ] Set up Bun project with Hono and Drizzle:
  - [ ] Initialize project with Bun
  - [ ] Configure Hono server
  - [ ] Set up Drizzle ORM
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript
  - [ ] Set up Zod validation schemas
- [ ] Implement Valkey connection and basic operations
- [ ] Create API endpoints with Zod validation:
  - [ ] Submit score (validate score format and range)
  - [ ] Get leaderboard (validate query parameters)
  - [ ] Get player rank (validate player ID)
- [ ] Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Add rate limiting using Valkey
- [ ] Write unit tests using Bun's test runner:
  - [ ] API endpoint validation tests
  - [ ] Schema validation tests
  - [ ] Integration tests with validation

### 4. Front-end Development 
- [ ] Set up Vue 3 project with Vite and TypeScript
- [ ] Create basic UI components:
  - [ ] Leaderboard display
  - [ ] Score submission form
  - [ ] Player rank display
- [ ] Implement Pinia store for state management
- [ ] Add real-time updates using WebSocket
- [ ] Implement responsive design
- [ ] Write unit tests

### 5. Integration and Testing 
- [ ] Integrate front end with back-end API
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing
- [ ] Perform load testing and optimize as needed

### 6. AWS Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Set up EC2 instance or ECS cluster
- [ ] Configure Amazon ElastiCache for Valkey
- [ ] Set up S3 bucket for front-end hosting
- [ ] Configure networking and security groups
- [ ] Install and configure Bun runtime environment

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline 
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows for front end and back end
- [ ] Set up automated testing using Bun's test runner
- [ ] Configure deployment to AWS
- [ ] Add Bun-specific build and optimization steps

### 8. Documentation and Open Source Prep
- [ ] Write comprehensive README
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md guide
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Add inline code comments

### 9. Final Testing and Launch (2-3 days)
- [ ] Perform final integration testing
- [ ] Do security audit
- [ ] Create demo instance
- [ ] Prepare launch announcement
