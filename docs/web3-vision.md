### 4. Technical Innovation Edge

1. **Smart Contract Architecture**
```typescript
// Public LeaderPort Core
export class LeaderPortCore {
    // Dual-Layer Architecture
    realTimeLayer: {
        updateScore(player: string, score: number): Promise<void>;
        getLeaderboard(): Promise<Score[]>;
    }
    
    blockchainLayer: {
        immortalizeScore(score: Score): Promise<void>;
        getHistoricalBest(): Promise<Score[]>;
        mintAchievementNFT(achievement: Achievement): Promise<NFT>;
    }

    // Anti-cheat and verification systems
    verificationSystem: {
        validateScore(score: Score): Promise<boolean>;
        communityConsensus(score: Score): Promise<boolean>;
    }
}

// Private Enhancement Layer
class LeaderPortPro {
    private algorithmEngine: AlgorithmEngine;
    
    async enhanceScore(score: number): Promise<number> {
        // Proprietary scoring algorithms
        // Advanced analytics
        // Custom multipliers
    }
}
```

2. **Move-Based Object Model Implementation**

Utilizing [Move](https://sui.io/move), an open source language for writing safe packages to manipulate on-chain objects (sometimes referred to as "smart contracts"), we get the following benefits:

   - Object-centric data structures for leaderboard entries
   - Native asset management for achievements and records
   - Efficient state management using Sui Objects
   ```move
   module leaderport::leaderboard {
       struct LeaderboardEntry has key {
           id: UID,
           player: address,
           score: u64,
           timestamp: u64,
           achievement_refs: vector<ID>
       }

       struct Achievement has key, store {
           id: UID,
           category: string,
           rarity: u8,
           metadata: vector<u8>
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Hybrid State Management**
   - On-chain permanent records for historical achievements
   - Off-chain real-time updates via Chrome extension
   - Layer 2 solutions for high-frequency updates
   - Sui Object model for efficient data organization
