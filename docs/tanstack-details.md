## TanStack Overview

For LeaderPort's real-time leaderboard system, we'll utilize the TanStack suite of libraries due to their production-ready status, comprehensive feature set, and excellent performance characteristics. Key benefits include:

- Production-proven reliability
- Type-safe by default
- Framework-agnostic design
- Extensive community support
- Enterprise-grade implementations

### Core Components for LeaderPort

#### 1. TanStack Query
Essential for leaderboard data management:
```typescript
import { createQuery } from '@tanstack/vue-query'

// Real-time score fetching
const leaderboardQuery = createQuery({
  queryKey: ['leaderboard'],
  queryFn: fetchLeaderboardData,
  refetchInterval: 1000, // Real-time updates
})

// Automatic background updates
watch(leaderboardQuery.data, (newData) => {
  updateLeaderboardUI(newData)
})
```

#### 2. TanStack Store
Efficient state management for real-time data:
```typescript
import { Store } from '@tanstack/store'

// Leaderboard state management
const leaderboardStore = new Store({
  state: {
    scores: [],
    playerRank: null,
    lastUpdate: null
  },
  onUpdate: () => {
    // Trigger UI updates efficiently
  }
})
```

#### 3. TanStack Virtual
Optimized rendering for large leaderboards:
```typescript
import { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/vue-virtual'

// Virtual scrolling for large leaderboards
const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({
  count: leaderboardData.value.length,
  getScrollElement: () => scrollElementRef.value,
  estimateSize: () => 50,
})
```

### Implementation Considerations

1. Data Management:
   - Use TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
   - Implement optimistic updates for score submissions
   - Configure automatic background refreshes

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Leverage TanStack Virtual for large datasets
   - Implement infinite scrolling for extensive leaderboards
   - Use TanStack Store for efficient state updates

3. Real-time Features:
   - WebSocket integration for live updates
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Efficient re-rendering strategies

### Research & Development Tasks
- [ ] Evaluate TanStack implementation:
  - [ ] Test TanStack Query for leaderboard data handling
  - [ ] Benchmark TanStack Store performance
  - [ ] Evaluate TanStack Virtual for large leaderboards
  - [ ] Document findings and recommendations

### Benefits for LeaderPort
1. Scalability:
   - Handles large datasets efficiently
   - Optimized for real-time updates
   - Built-in caching and background updates

2. Developer Experience:
   - Comprehensive TypeScript support
   - Excellent documentation
   - Active community support

3. Production Readiness:
   - Battle-tested in large applications
   - Enterprise support available
   - Regular updates and maintenance

### Integration with Bun/Hono
TanStack's framework-agnostic design allows seamless integration with our Bun/Hono backend:
```typescript
// Backend API endpoint
app.get('/api/leaderboard', async (c) => {
  const data = await getLeaderboardData()
  return c.json(data)
})

// Frontend integration
const leaderboard = createQuery({
  queryKey: ['leaderboard'],
  queryFn: () => fetch('/api/leaderboard').then(r => r.json())
})
```

For detailed implementation examples and best practices, refer to the [TanStack documentation](https://tanstack.com/docs/latest).

For state management overview, see [State Management Guide](./state-management.md).

## Implementation Strategy Update

After analyzing the LeaderPort API codebase, TanStack would be more valuable on the frontend/extension side rather than in the API for several reasons:

1. The API already handles:
   - Efficient caching (Redis)
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling
   - Data transformation

2. TanStack's primary benefits (Query, Cache, Virtual) are most useful for:
   - Client-side data fetching
   - Cache management
   - UI virtualization
   - State management

3. For the browser extension, TanStack Query would be excellent for:
   - Managing API requests
   - Caching responses
   - Handling real-time updates
   - Background data refetching
   - Optimistic updates

## Revised Architecture

Keep the current API architecture as is, and implement TanStack in the browser extension/frontend where its features will provide the most value. The API's role should remain focused on:
- Serving data efficiently
- Managing caching
- Handling rate limiting
- Processing requests

The frontend/extension can then use TanStack Query to optimally consume and manage this API data.
