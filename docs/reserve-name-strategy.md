Here's a strategic approach to reserving your Chrome Extension name:

## Chrome Web Store Reservation Strategy

### Minimum Viable Extension
1. **Create a Basic Extension**
- Upload a simple "coming soon" version
- Include basic manifest.json with your branding
- Implement minimal functionality (e.g., a placeholder popup)
- Use your final intended name and branding

### Required Assets
1. **Branding Elements**
- Extension icon (128x128 PNG)
- Store listing icon (128x128 PNG)
- At least one screenshot
- Promotional banner images
- Clear description of planned features

2. **Store Listing Requirements**
- Privacy policy URL
- Developer website/contact information
- Category selection
- Detailed description of future functionality

### Best Practices
1. **Visibility Settings**
- Initially list as "Unlisted" to prevent broad discovery
- Use this time for testing and preparation
- Switch to "Public" when ready for full launch

2. **Version Strategy**
- Start with version 0.1.0 or similar
- Clearly mark as "Beta" or "Preview"
- Set expectations about development timeline

3. **Legal Protection**
- Consider trademark registration
- Document your publication date
- Maintain consistent branding across platforms

### Important Notes
- Publishing a basic version establishes your name claim
- Chrome Web Store requires unique extension names
- Early publication provides a foundation for gathering early user feedback
- Keep the store listing updated with development progress

This approach helps secure your extension name while maintaining transparency with potential users about the development status.
