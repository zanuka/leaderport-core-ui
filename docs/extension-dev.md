# LeaderPort Extension Dev Workflow

A simple Chrome Extension starter project that uses Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Bun + Icon Generation

## Prerequistes

Keep in mind I've created this starter using my personal preferences and it should be easy enough to swap out any of the technologies to match your own prefs. 

### Installing Bun

Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime like Node.js, but with a focus on performance and developer experience. You can also just use npm or pnpm, whatever works for you. 

To install Bun, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

This command will download and install Bun on your system. Make sure to follow any additional instructions provided by the installer to add Bun to your system's PATH.

### Why Use Bun?

- **Performance**: Bun is designed to be fast, with a focus on speed for both startup and runtime performance.
- **Built-in Tools**: Bun includes a bundler, transpiler, and package manager, reducing the need for additional tools.
- **Compatibility**: Bun aims to be compatible with Node.js, making it easier to transition existing projects.
- **Developer Experience**: With features like hot module reloading and a fast development server, Bun enhances the development workflow.


## Development

Install dependencies:

`bun install`

To start the development server:

`bun run dev`

To build the extension:

`bun run build`

## Icon Generation

To generate icons for the extension, run the following command:

`bun scripts/generate-icons.js`

This will generate the following icons in the `public/assets` directory:
- `icon-16.png`
- `icon-24.png`
- `icon-32.png`
- `icon-48.png`
- `icon-128.png`

## Loading the Extension
1. Build the project using `bun run build`
2. Open your Chrome-compatible browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
3. Navigate to the extensions page:
    - Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
    - Edge: `edge://extensions`
    - Brave: `brave://extensions`
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory from your project
6. After pinning it, the extension should now appear in your browser toolbar

**Note:** After making changes, run `bun run build` again and click the refresh icon on the extension card in your browser's extension page.

## UI Testing
You should see this after pinning the new extension:

![Preview A](./src/assets/preview-a.png)

## Basic Functionality
Through some basic DOM manipulation, you can set a custom background color. 

![Preview B](./src/assets/preview-b.png)

## Dependencies

- **sharp**: A high-performance image processing library that allows you to resize, crop, and manipulate images in various formats. It's used for generating icons and other image assets efficiently.
- **vue**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue is used in this project to create dynamic and interactive components for the Chrome extension.

## Why Vue?
Just a personal preference. I'd likely also incorporate Tailwind and shadcn/ui but you can just use Vanilla JS and plain-old css as well. I think for more complex extensions, using Vue, React, or Svelte would be a good way to future-proof things and re-use components. 

## Dev Dependencies

- **@types/chrome**: Provides TypeScript type definitions for the Chrome extension APIs, enabling better type checking and IntelliSense in your development environment.
- **@vitejs/plugin-vue**: A Vite plugin that provides support for Vue 3 single-file components, allowing you to use Vue's template syntax and features.
- **typescript**: A language for application-scale JavaScript, providing static type definitions to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development server and optimized build process for modern web projects.
- **vue-tsc**: A TypeScript compiler for Vue single-file components, ensuring type safety and compatibility with TypeScript in your Vue project.
