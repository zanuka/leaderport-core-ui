# Frontend Design
VueValkyrie's frontend is designed to provide a seamless, responsive, and real-time leaderboard experience. It leverages Vue 3's Composition API for efficient component design, Pinia for state management, and integrates with a Go backend using RESTful APIs and WebSockets for real-time updates. The frontend focuses on delivering a smooth user experience with fast load times, reactive updates, and a clean, intuitive interface for displaying leaderboards and submitting scores.

Key features of the frontend include:
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop browsers
- Real-time leaderboard updates using WebSockets
- Efficient state management and data caching with Pinia and PiniaColada
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Fast development and build times with Vite
- Customizable and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Comprehensive testing suite using Cypress and Vitest

This architecture ensures a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance frontend that can handle the dynamic nature of leaderboard data while providing an engaging user experience.


## Frontend Architecture

VueValkyrie's frontend architecture is built on a modern, robust stack designed for performance, scalability, and developer productivity:

1. **Vue 3 with Composition API**: 
   - Leverages the latest Vue features for efficient and scalable component design
   - Enables better code organization and reusability through composable functions

2. **TypeScript**: 
   - Enhances code quality and developer experience with static typing
   - Provides better tooling support and helps catch errors early in development

3. **Pinia for State Management**: 
   - Offers a smooth and reactive data flow throughout the application
   - Provides a more intuitive and less boilerplate-heavy alternative to Vuex

4. **PiniaColada**: 
   - An additional layer working on top of Pinia, focusing on data fetching and caching
   - Inspired by React Query but designed for seamless integration with Pinia and Vue 3
   - Offers features like automatic persistence and simplified setup

5. **Vite as Build Tool**: 
   - Provides next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and optimized production builds
   - Offers near-instantaneous server start and hot module replacement (HMR)

6. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: 
   - Utility-first CSS framework for creating a responsive and customizable UI
   - Enables rapid UI development with pre-built classes

7. **Testing Framework**:
   - Cypress for end-to-end testing, simulating real user interactions
   - Vitest for fast, ESM-native unit and component testing

This architecture is designed to provide a solid foundation for building a high-performance, maintainable, and scalable frontend for VueValkyrie. The combination of Vue 3's reactivity system, Pinia's state management, and PiniaColada's data fetching capabilities allows for efficient data flow and management throughout the application.



### Frontend API Integration

The Vue app communicates with the Go backend using a robust API integration strategy:

1. **Axios for HTTP Requests**: 
   - Custom instance with base URL and default headers
   - Request/response interceptors for consistent error handling and authentication

   ```typescript
   // api/axios.ts
   import axios from 'axios';

   const api = axios.create({
     baseURL: process.env.VUE_APP_API_URL,
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     },
   });

   api.interceptors.request.use(/* ... */);
   api.interceptors.response.use(/* ... */);

   export default api;
   ```

2. **API Service Layer**:
   - Abstraction for API calls, making them easily reusable across the app

   ```typescript
   // services/leaderboardService.ts
   import api from '@/api/axios';

   export const getLeaderboard = async (params) => {
     const response = await api.get('/leaderboard', { params });
     return response.data;
   };

   export const submitScore = async (score) => {
     const response = await api.post('/scores', score);
     return response.data;
   };
   ```

3. **WebSocket Integration**:
   - Real-time updates using native WebSocket API or a library like `socket.io-client`


### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit and Component Tests**:
   - Vitest for fast, ESM-native unit testing
   - Vue Testing Library for component testing with a focus on user interactions

   ```typescript
   // tests/components/LeaderboardItem.test.ts
   import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/vue';
   import LeaderboardItem from '@/components/LeaderboardItem.vue';

   test('renders player name and score', () => {
     render(LeaderboardItem, { props: { player: { name: 'John', score: 1000 } } });
     expect(screen.getByText('John')).toBeInTheDocument();
     expect(screen.getByText('1000')).toBeInTheDocument();
   });
   ```

2. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Cypress for comprehensive E2E testing, simulating real user scenarios

   ```javascript
   // cypress/integration/leaderboard.spec.js
   describe('Leaderboard', () => {
     it('displays top players', () => {
       cy.visit('/leaderboard');
       cy.get('[data-testid="leaderboard-item"]').should('have.length', 10);
       cy.get('[data-testid="leaderboard-item"]').first().should('contain', 'Rank #1');
     });
   });
   ```

### Error Handling and Logging with Rollbar

By leveraging Rollbar, VueValkyrie can maintain a high-quality user experience, quickly address issues, and continuously improve the application's stability and performance. 

1. **Real-time Error Monitoring**: Rollbar can capture and report errors in real-time, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues in the VueValkyrie frontend.

2. **Detailed Error Context**: Rollbar provides rich context for each error, including stack traces, request parameters, and user information, making debugging more efficient.

3. **User Impact Analysis**: With Rollbar's user tracking, we can understand how errors affect specific users or groups, prioritizing fixes based on impact.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Beyond error tracking, Rollbar can help monitor application performance, identifying slow-loading components or API calls.

5. **Customizable Alerts**: Set up custom alert rules to notify the development team about critical issues immediately.

6. **Error Grouping and Deduplication**: Rollbar automatically groups similar errors, reducing noise and helping focus on unique issues.

7. **Integration with Development Workflow**: Rollbar can integrate with issue trackers and communication tools, streamlining the bug-fixing process.

8. **Release Tracking**: Monitor the impact of new releases on error rates, helping to quickly identify and rollback problematic deployments.
